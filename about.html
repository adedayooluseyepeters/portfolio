    <h2 style="color: #0c1f3f; margin-bottom: 1rem;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      I am <strong>Adedayo Oluseye Peters</strong>, a dedicated legal professional with over a decade of experience in various complex and technical areas of law, including litigation, corporate law, real estate, family law, and legal education. My career journey has taken me from courtroom advocacy to corporate legal management and law lecturing.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      I earned my <strong>Master of Laws (LL.M)</strong> from the University of Lagos, following a strong academic foundation with an LL.B from Olabisi Onabanjo University and a Barrister-at-Law certification from the Nigerian Law School. In addition to practicing law, I’ve served as a lecturer and facilitator, passionately contributing to the development of future legal professionals.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      Throughout my career, I have worked with prestigious firms such as Rosefields Solicitors and Malcolm Omirhobo & Co, and I currently lead <strong>ADEDAYO ADESANYA-PETERS CHAMBERS</strong> in Ogun State, Nigeria. My areas of focus include debt recovery, real estate management, corporate advisory, and asset tracing.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      I believe in ethical, efficient, and client-centered legal service, and I strive to empower individuals, families, and organizations through sound legal strategies and education.
    </p>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 4px solid #ffd700; padding-left: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;">
      "Justice delayed is justice denied — and I work every day to ensure justice is delivered with excellence."
